                    <p class="text">The Himalayas are a very young and fragile mountain range situated in a highly active seismic zone. Landslides and earthquakes are a perennial occurrence in its remote and inaccessible valleys that are nevertheless densely populated. The extreme topography of the region makes infrastructure development a very difficult task indeed. The problem is further exacerbated by deforestation caused due to dependence of local population on forests for its energy needs. </p> 
                    <p class="text"><img src="img/renewable/renewable1.jpg" alt="Solar panels are being carried to remote villages" width="268" height="200" class="imgleft" style="margin-bottom:15px">Connecting remote habitations to the main grid for electricity and making fossil fuels available for all energy needs, through this rugged terrain is a gigantic enterprise with massive investments in the distribution infrastructure. In those areas where it has been possible to do so, usually the villages that are near the urban locations, the system suffers from a chronically erratic transmission/distribution regimen. </p>
                    <p class="text">The sheer logistics of erecting and maintaining poles and wires, and transporting fossil fuels over some of the highest ranges in the world prove that the conditions prevailing in the region are not conducive to macro solutions. The problems associated with disruption and breakdown are constant and intractable involving high expenses. People in the interior areas then revert to more conventional means for their lighting and heating requirements i.e. burning kerosene oil or pine bark, and wood.</p>
                    <p class="text">Renewable Energy Technologies, apart from providing clean energy, can also address these issues of reliability caused due to remoteness and terrain, which necessitates micro solutions with a decentralized approach. While there has been much discourse on the efficacy of renewable energy, efforts to translate it into a practically viable option are still in their infancy.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is in this context that we initiated a dialogue with the people in our project area, about solar technology as a viable option to meet their energy needs. After having demonstrated effectiveness of solar energy in providing micro solutions, we have gone on to develop processes for using waste and destructive biomass for meeting energy needs, both electrical and thermal. These renewable energy technologies have been disseminated through community systems</p>
                    <p class="text">We have developed and disseminated following Renewable Energy Technologies:</p>
